# SortingTest
A few python sorting algorithms and functions to time them.
By default, running will test Python's built-in sort, merge sort, selection sort, and bubble sort, on array sizes of 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, and 20000, with 5 trials, and will write the results to a csv file called "SortComparisonResults.csv".
I can't be bothered to write a cli for this, so just change the code if you want to mess with those parameters. The comments explain what to change.
